## What this is
h4_Live is a ComfyUI node pack that adds memory, loop control, traffic routing, context bundling, and a pile of “why the hell doesn’t Comfy already do this?” utilities.

ComfyUI is amazing, but most workflows are basically: generate, forget, done.  
h4_Live makes workflows capable of doing stuff like:
- “First pass, do the heavy work.”
- “Then loop, refine, and improve it a few times.”
- “Change settings each loop.”
- “Compare results.”
- “Run test grids without losing your mind.”

This started as a simple switch node. Then we blinked. Now it’s an ecosystem.

---

## Read this first: QoL features (OFF by default)
### Important reality check
All QoL features ship **OFF by default** now.

There is **no global QoL master toggle** for h4_Live. If you want QoL features, you must enable them **individually** inside ComfyUI’s settings.

Why we do it this way:
- Some people want a clean canvas with zero UI behavior changes.
- Some people are sensitive to extra overlays, snap behavior, or louder errors.
- And honestly, consent matters. Your UI should not get possessed without permission.

### Where to enable them
In ComfyUI Settings, find the h4_Live-related toggles and enable only what you actually want. You will typically need to refresh the page after enabling UI features.

If you cannot find the toggles:
- Make sure the node pack is installed correctly.
- Make sure the frontend extensions are actually loading.
- Check the browser console for extension load messages.

### What you get (when enabled)
Below is the “in painful detail” breakdown of every QoL enhancement. This section is long on purpose, because people deserve to know what they are turning on.

#### 1) Smart node snapping
**What you’ll notice:** nodes “want” to line up when you drag them.

**What it’s for:** clean graphs, less time fiddling, fewer cursed spaghetti canvases.

**How it behaves:**
- While dragging a node, it will gently snap into alignment with nearby nodes.
- It is meant to feel like a helpful nudge, not a cage match.
- If you intentionally place nodes off-grid, it should still let you do that.

**When to disable it:**
- If you do a lot of freeform layout.
- If snapping makes you feel like your mouse is haunted.

#### 2) Dynamic I/O coloring
**What you’ll notice:** sockets become easier to read at a glance.

**What it’s for:** preventing dumb mistakes like “why won’t this latent connect to this image thing” at 2:13 AM.

**How it helps:**
- Inputs and outputs visually signal what kind of data they expect.
- You can detect mismatches before you connect stuff wrong and blame the universe.

**When to disable it:**
- If you prefer the stock ComfyUI look.
- If you find extra color noisy.

#### 3) Auto-context memory
**What you’ll notice:** settings stick around more reliably between sessions, reloads, or node recreations.

**What it’s for:** reducing repeated setup work.

**How it behaves:**
- Remembers certain choices so you do not reconfigure the same stuff constantly.
- Helps when you are iterating fast and your brain is in “keep moving” mode.

**When to disable it:**
- If you do a lot of one-off experiments and want a clean slate every time.
- If you share workflows and want them to open “neutral.”

#### 4) Visual debug overlays
**What you’ll notice:** extra on-canvas visibility into what is happening.

**What it’s for:** debugging without adding five display nodes and praying.

**Typical uses:**
- See what data is flowing.
- Spot obvious “wrong type” or “empty output” problems faster.
- Reduce the “queue, fail, scroll logs, queue again” loop.

**When to disable it:**
- If overlays distract you.
- If you record tutorials and want a clean canvas.

#### 5) Enhanced error reporting (jarring popup warning)
**What you’ll notice:** when something fails, the error dialog might feel… intense.

It can be a little shocking the first time because it’s louder and more informative than stock comfy logging.

**Why we do it anyway:**
- Standard errors often tell you almost nothing useful.
- The enhanced reporting aims to give you the “what, where, why, and what to do next” in one shot.
- It is designed to reduce time-to-fix by a lot.

**What kind of detail it tends to include:**
- Which node failed, and what it was doing.
- What type it expected, and what it got.
- Any relevant state that helps reproduce the bug.

**When to disable it:**
- If you prefer minimal interruption.
- If you are sensitive to aggressive error UI.

#### 6) Caffeine Mode (Wake Lock)
**What you’ll notice:** a UI toggle that helps keep your screen awake during long runs.

**What it’s for:**
- Long batch runs.
- Grids.
- Overnight queues.
- That one time you do 300 steps and forget you live in a world with sleep timers.

**Important notes:**
- It depends on browser support.
- It may turn off if the tab loses focus or the browser decides to be “helpful.”

#### 7) Privacy-aware console sanitization
**What you’ll notice:** logs try to avoid dumping sensitive personal info.

**What it’s for:**
- Screenshots.
- Shared logs.
- Debugging without accidentally leaking your life story.

## The BigBrother thing (privacy + what it actually does)
You will see a frontend file named something like `h4_BigBrother.js`. Yes, the name is spicy. No, it is not spying on you.

### What it is
BigBrother is the frontend QoL bundle. It powers things like snapping, overlays, socket coloring, and other UI helpers.

### What it is NOT
- It is NOT silently uploading your workflows.
- It is NOT logging everything you do “in the background” by default.
- It is NOT a telemetry system that phones home.

### The key privacy point
Even if you see BigBrother messages in the console, **it is not actively logging anything sensitive until you explicitly enable the relevant toggles in Settings**.

So:
- Installed does not mean enabled.
- Loaded does not mean “recording.”
- You stay in control.

---

## Core concepts (loops, memory, wireless)
No jargon section, promised.

### Loops
A loop is just: do the workflow, then do it again, using the previous output as the next input.

Why it’s useful:
- First pass creates the idea.
- Later passes refine it.
- You can ramp settings over time.
- You can do controlled experiments without rewiring everything.

### Memory
h4_Live keeps state in a global place so nodes can coordinate.
That means a node can know:
- What loop you are on.
- Whether you “reset.”
- What the last output was.

### Wireless
ComfyUI really does not like cycles in the graph. If you directly wire output back into earlier inputs, it can throw errors because the workflow is supposed to be a DAG, not a snake eating its own tail.

Wireless mode exists to break the physical cycle:
- Store data in memory.
- Retrieve it later.
- Keep the visible graph acyclic.
- Still get true feedback loops.

This is the whole “The Buffer fixes the loop problem” thing. It is not magic, it is just smarter architecture.

## Nodes (friendly guide, minimal jargon)

### The Book of H4 (In-App Help)
**What it is:** A massive, built-in documentation system inside the node pack itself.

**How to use it:**
- Look at the top-right of **ANY** h4_Live node.
- See that little `?` button? Click it.
- A drawer slides out and explains **everything** about that node. Inputs, outputs, pro-tips, and what the hell "Occlusion Enabled" actually means.

**Why we made it:**
- Because Alt-Tabbing to a wiki sucks.
- Because I (the dev) forget what my own nodes do sometimes.
- It reads from a central "Lore" file that we keep updated with the code.

---

### H4_TrafficRouter (The Nexus)
**What it is:** The Grand Central Station of your workflow. It decides what data goes into your KSampler based on whether you are starting fresh or looping.

**The Knobs:**
- **first_denoise (Default 1.00):** This is for your "Creation" pass. Usually, you want 1.0 to let the model hallucinate freely from noise.
- **loop_denoise (Default 0.45):** This is for your "Refinement" passes. You lower this so the model doesn't destroy what it just built. It tweaks, it doesn't wreck.
- **restart (Bool):** The "Reset the Universe" button. If TRUE, the loop count goes back to 0. If FALSE, we march forward into infinity.
- **first_run_in**: Connect your Latent/Image/Model from the *start* of the workflow here.
- **loop_run_in**: Connect the output from the *end* of your loop here.

**How it works:**
- **Loop 0 (First Run):** It passes `first_run_in` and outputs `first_denoise`.
- **Loop 1+ (The Grind):** It passes `loop_run_in` and outputs `loop_denoise`.
- It handles the switching so you don't have to manually mute/unmute nodes like a caveman.

---

### H4_TrafficMerge (The Zipper)
**What it is:** The Router's slightly smarter, safer cousin. It's designed specifically to avoid ComfyUI's "Cycle Detected" errors which are the bane of my existence.

**The Input Trap (Read this):**
- **first_run_in**: Wire your starting data here.
- **loop_input**: **DO NOT WIRE THIS.** I repeat, do not put a wire here if it comes from later in the graph. That creates a cycle.
  - **The Magic Trick:** Leave `loop_input` EMPTY. The node will automatically check the **H4_ImageBuffer** wirelessly. It teleports data from the end of the graph back to the start without a visible wire. This keeps ComfyUI happy and prevents the red/pink error screen of death.

**The Knobs:**
- Same as Router (`first_denoise`, `loop_denoise`, `restart`).
- **Type Safety:** It memorizes what type of data you passed in Run 0 (e.g., LATENT). If Run 1 tries to send an IMAGE, it screams at you. This prevents those silent failures where your KSampler explodes because you fed it pixels instead of math.

---

### H4_TrafficCop (The Legacy Splitter)
**What it is:** A simple fork in the road.
**Why:** Sometimes you don't need Denoise control. You just want "Input A goes here on start, and Input B goes here later".
**The "Safe Mode":** This node refuses to output `None`. If a path is inactive, it sends duplicate data anyway. This prevents "Missing Input" errors downstream. It's the training wheels of logic gates.

---

### H4_StateMonitor (The Scoreboard)
**What it is:** A text readout of the current Loop Count found in the system memory.
**Why:** Because debugging invisible logic is hell. Connect this to see if you are actually looping or just stuck on "Run 0" forever.
**Daisy Chaining:** It has an optional pass-through input. Connect your Logic node here to force the Monitor to execute *after* the logic decides the count.

---

### H4_LoopIncrementer (The Clicker)
**What it is:** The thing that makes the number go up.
**Why:** A Router routes, but it doesn't always increment. Sometimes you want to increment manually or at a specific point in the chain.
**Wireless Reset Support:** If the "Wireless Reset" toggle is ON, it listens for a distress signal from the **H4_WirelessResetButton**. If it hears one, it resets the count to 0 instantly.

---

### H4_WirelessResetButton (The Red Button)
**What it is:** A toggle to nuke the loop count.
**Why:** You are 50 loops deep into a render and it looks like garbage. You want to restart. You don't want to find the Router and toggle its widget. You just flip this button anywhere on the canvas.
**How:** It sets a global flag in Python memory. The **LoopIncrementer** sees it and executes the restart order.

---

### H4_ImageBuffer (The Teleporter)
**What it is:** The MVP of loop workflows.
**What it does:** It takes any data (Image, Latent, Text, Model) and stores it in your RAM.
**Why this exists:**
- ComfyUI is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Loops are Cycles. Cycles are illegal.
- **The Cheat:** The Buffer breaks the cycle. It saves data to RAM in "Write Mode". In the next execution, the **TrafficMerge** reads that data from RAM. No wire connection = No cycle error = Happy ComfyUI.
- **Usage:** Place this at the VERY END of your loop. Feed it the final result. Leave the output unconnected (or connect it to a preview). It handles the storage silently.

---

### H4_ContextHub (The Mothership)
**What it is:** The infinite bag of holding for your data.
**The Problem:** You have a Model, VAE, CLIP, Positive, Negative, Latent, and Image. You need to pass them to 5 different KSamplers. That's 35 wires. You are creating a spaghetti monster.
**The Solution:** Wire them ALL into the Hub once. It bundles them into a single `H4_PIPE` cable. Now you route ONE wire to your destination.
**Inputs:**
- **Standard Types:** Model, VAE, CLIP, Positive, Negative, Latent, Image, Mask.
- **Any_A / Any_B:** Two mystery slots for whatever weird custom data you need (ControlNet stack? LoRA stack? A string? Your hopes and dreams?).
- **base_pipe:** Daisy-chain support. Plug an existing pipe here to add to it or override it.

---

### H4_ContextUnpack (The Loot Piñata)
**What it is:** The thing that opens the bag.
**How to use:** Plug the `H4_PIPE` in one side. All your individual data comes out the other side.
**Why:** Use Hub at the start. Use Unpack at the end. Keep the middle clean. If you wire a pipe into a KSampler without unpacking it first, nothing happens because KSamplers don't speak H4.

---

## Mission control and scheduling

### H4_MissionControl (The Dashboard)
**What it is:** The cockpit for your loop workflow.
**Modes:**
- **Passive (Default):** It sits there and looks pretty. It passes signals but does NOT increment the loop count. Use this if you have a separate `LoopIncrementer` elsewhere.
- **Active (Master Base):** This Node is CAPTAIN. It increments the global loop count every time it runs. **WARNING:** Do not have two Active nodes in one workflow or your loop count will jump by 2, 3, 4... and you'll be confused.
- **wireless_reset (Bool):** If ON, it listens for the `WirelessResetButton`.
- **debug_mode (Bool):** If ON, it spams your console with logs. Use only if you are desperate.

**Passthrough Ports:**
- `scheduler_val` and `scheduler_seed` are just inputs that pass through to the output. Why? So you can bundle your control signals into one tidy node before sending them out to the rest of the graph.

---

### H4_LinearScheduler (The Ramp)
**What it is:** A mathematical ramp generator.
**The Math:** `Start + (End - Start) * (Current_Loop / Max_Loops)`
**Why you need it:**
- **Denoise Ramps:** Start at 1.0 (Creation) and ramp down to 0.1 (Refinement) over 10 loops.
- **CFG Ramps:** Start low and ramp high to "tighten" the image as it converges.
- **Inputs:**
  - `start_val`: Value at Loop 0.
  - `end_val`: Value at the final loop.
  - `max_loops`: How long the ramp lasts. If you keep looping past this, it stays at `end_val`.

---

### H4_SeedGenerator (The Chaos Engine)
**What it is:** Controls the sophisticated random number generation for your loops.
**Modes:**
- **Incremental:** (Start Seed + Loop Count). Run 0 uses Seed X. Run 1 uses Seed X+1. This gives you *deterministic variation*. Great for making animations that don't jitter like a strobe light.
- **Fixed:** Always outputs `start_seed`. Boring, but useful for testing logic without the variable changing.
- **Random:** Pure chaos. New seed every time, unrelated to the loop count. Use this when you are just exploring.

---

## Display and debugging

### H4_SmartConsole (The MRI Machine)
**What it is:** A node that looks *inside* your data and prints a report.
**Inputs:**
- **Anything In:** Wire literally anything here.
- **+ULTRA Mode (Bool):**
  - **OFF (False):** Prints basic info like "Tensor Shape [1, 512, 512, 3]" or "String: 'Hello'".
  - **ON (True - Nuclear Mode):** It rips the object apart. It lists attributes, internal methods, min/max values for tensors, mean values, memory addresses, and basically deconstructs the matrix. Use this when you have a `KeyError` and don't know why. It prints to the system console (the black window) AND shows a summary on the node itself.

---

### H4_SeedSequencer (The Chaos Controller)
**What it is:** A smarter, state-aware seed generator.
**Why use it over the basic Generator?**
- **State Memory:** It remembers what it did last time.
- **Random Digits:** You can tell it "Give me a random seed, but only 4 digits long". Why? Because `9352` is easier to read and type than `352859205820582`.
- **Auto-Advance:** It can increment automatically independent of the global loop count. Useful if you want to hold a seed for 3 loops, then switch.

---

## Gridinator and testing suite

### H4_Gridinator (IT’S OVER 9000!)
**What it is:** A monolithic node that renders entire X/Y/Z grids in one go.
**Why:** Because wiring up 50 KSamplers to make a 10x10 grid is insane.
**The Feature List:**
- **Fuzzy Loading:** Type "ponym" in `base_model_fuzzy` and it figures out you mean `PonyDiffusion_v6_XL.safetensors`.
- **Prompt Stutter:** Use syntax like `[cat*3]` to repeat a word 3 times for emphasis.
- **Permutations:** Use `{red|blue|green}` to automatically split the batch into 3 variations.
- **The Axes (X/Y/Z):**
  - **Modes:** Model, LoRA, Steps, CFG, Denoise, Sampler, Scheduler, Seed.
  - **Overrides:** The text boxes allow comma-separated values (e.g., `20, 30, 40`).
  - **Fuzzy Overrides:** You can type "juggernaut, pony, animagine" in the Model Override box and it loads them all sequentially.
- **Sliding Scales:** Enable this to auto-generate ranges (e.g., Denoise 0.2 to 0.8 over 10 frames) without typing the numbers.

**The Output:** A nice, labeled grid image with headers, margins, and readable text.

---

### H4_AxisDriver (The Sidekick)
**What it is:** A helper node for the Gridinator.
**Usage:**
- It allows you to build complex axis configurations (Preset lists) and feed them into the Gridinator as a JSON blob.
- Mostly used if you are creating a "Preset Bank" of grids (e.g., "My Standard Render Test").
- You likely won't touch this manually unless you are a cyborg.

### H4_Comparinator (The A/B Test God)
**What it is:** The bastard child of a lightbox, a diff viewer, and a forensic lab. It lets you compare two images with a sliding reticle, zoom in to see atomic-level defects, and crawl the graph to see exactly how you messed up your settings.

**The Inputs:**
- **image_a**: The "Control" or "Before" image. If you don't plug this in, the node sits there judging you.
- **image_b**: The "Test" or "After" image.
- **frozen_image**: If connected, this overrides Image B. Useful if you want to lock a specific state while you ruin Image A with experiments.
- **metadata_text**: JSON metadata injection. See SmartSave. Same deal.
- **save_mode**: If ON, it saves comparisons to disk. If OFF, it's just for looking pretty.

**The Interface (Where the magic happens):**
- **Compare Mode (Slider):** A red line splits the screen. Drag it. Left is A, Right is B. It's fluid, lag-free, and addictive.
- **Blink Mode (Spacebar):** Hold Spacebar to make Image B vanish. Release to bring it back. Because sometimes dragging a slider isn't fast enough for your brain to catch the difference.
- **Inspectinator Mode:** Toggle this switch to turn the right pane into a microscope. Points a reticle on the left, shows a zoomed view on the right. Now with a **500% Zoom Slider** because apparently 100% wasn't enough for you pixel peepers.
- **Parameter Drawer:** The "How did I make this?" panel. It crawls your workflow graph (yes, backwards) to find the KSampler, Seed, Steps, and Prompts that created the image. It even logs the history so you can see settings from 50 generations ago.

**History Strip:**
- Stores your last 50 runs.
- **Single Click:** Loads that image into the "B" slot for comparison against the current live output.
- **Double Click:** Opens the Lightbox.
- **Right Click:** Locks an image as "Reference". It gets a gold border. Now EVERY new generation compares against this locked image. Perfect for "can I beat my best result?" sessions.

**Why use it:**
- because "eyeballing it" is for amateurs.
- because you need to prove RGTHREE's scheduler is actually different.
- because it looks cool.

---

## Data processing and batch tools

### H4_DataStream (Batch Loader)
**What it is:** folder-based batch loader that auto-queues.

**What it does:**
- Load a folder.
- Hit Queue once.
- It processes files sequentially and keeps queueing for you.

**When to use it:**
- Batch edits.
- Face pipelines.
- Any repetitive folder job where clicking Queue 50 times feels like punishment.

---

### H4_PixelPress (SSAA/HDR)
**What it is:** The "Retina" engine.

**What it does:**
- **Supersampling**: Scales up (2x/3x/4x) -> Sharpens -> Scales down.
- **HDR**: optional dynamic range expansion (Shadows/Highlights).

**When to use it:**
- When you want dense, tailored details without aliasing.
- To fix lighting on bland images.

---

### H4_PixelVisualizer (Diff Inspector)
**What it is:** a pixel-level difference analyzer that shows you exactly what changed between two images.

**What it does:**
- Takes Image A (original) and Image B (processed) and produces four outputs:
  1. **Heatmap**: A black image where identical pixels stay dark, and differing pixels glow. The brighter the glow, the bigger the change. Use `heatmap_scale` to amplify subtle differences.
  2. **Side-by-Side**: A composite image showing A on the left and B on the right, stitched together.
  3. **Image A**: Passthrough of the original.
  4. **Image B**: Passthrough of the processed image.

**Settings:**
- `heatmap_scale`: Default 5.0. Range 0.0 to 100.0. Higher values make even tiny differences visible. At 5.0, you'll see obvious changes. At 50.0+, you'll catch sub-pixel differences that are invisible to the naked eye.

**When to use it:**
- After running H4_PixelPress (SSAA/HDR) to verify the enhancement is actually doing something.
- Comparing two different sampler outputs to see where they diverge.
- Debugging "these images look identical" situations, the heatmap will prove they are not.
- Quality control on face swaps to see exactly where blending occurs.

**How to read the heatmap:**
- Pure black = identical pixels. No change.
- Dim glow = very subtle differences (color grading, slight noise).
- Bright glow = significant changes (sharpening, HDR, face swap regions).
- If the heatmap is completely black at scale 5.0, your processing node genuinely did nothing.

**Resolution mismatch handling:**
- If Image A and Image B have different resolutions, Image B is automatically resized to match A using bilinear interpolation before comparison.

### H4_Varianator (Latent Riffler)
**What it is:** A jazz musician in node form. It takes a latent image and "riffs" on it to create variations.
**The Problem:** You have a generation you like, but the eyes are weird or you want to see if it looks better with slightly different noise.
**The Solution:** Feed it to the Varianator.
**The Knobs:**
- **variation_count:** How many remixes do you want? (1-16).
- **variation_profile:**
  - **Minimal:** Subtle changes. Good for fixing small defects or shifting expression.
  - **Moderate:** The standard riff. Noticeably different but keeps the soul of the original.
  - **Major:** Heavy improvisation. Might change the composition entirely.
- **seed_mode:**
  - **Fixed:** Riffs the same way every time.
  - **Increment:** Each variation uses a new seed (Start, Start+1, Start+2). **Recommended**.
  - **Random:** Total chaos.
- **denoise:** The strength of the riff. Lower = closer to original. Higher = more drift.

**Output:** A batch of images. Feed this into `H4_Comparinator` or a `Grid` to pick the winner.

## Image enhancement and visuals

### H4_PixelPress (The God of Crispness)
**What it is:** A True Supersampling (SSAA) node.
**How it works:**
1. **Upscale:** It blows your image up (2x, 3x, or 4x) using a model or Lanczos.
2. **Enhance:** It applies High Dynamic Range (HDR) tonemapping, shadow recovery, and sharpening at this massive resolution.
3. **Downscale:** It squashes the image back down to the original size using Lanczos.
**The Result:** Impossible details. Aliasing is destroyed. Lighting pops. It looks like an 8K photo shrunk down.
**The Knobs:**
- **supersample_scale:** 2x is usually enough. 4x is for heavy VRAM users.
- **sharpness:** Post-downscale sharpening. 0.3 is the sweet spot.
- **enable_hdr (Bool):** Turns on the magic sauce.
  - **hdr_intensity:** How much "pop" to add.
  - **shadow_intensity:** Recovers details in the dark areas.
  - **highlight_intensity:** Tames blown-out lights.
  - **gamma/contrast:** Fine-tuning.
- **tiled_processing:** **KEEP THIS ON.** Unless you have 48GB VRAM, processing a 4096x4096x4 (64MP) image in one go will crash your PC. Tiling saves lives.

**Warning:** This node is slow because it does a LOT of math. Use it at the end of your workflow, not during the sketch phase.

---

### H4_NoteInjector (Visuals)
**What it is:** Adds a title bar to your image.
**Why:**
- To label your grid tests.
- To create meme formats.
- To add "Cinematic Black Bars" with text.
**Features:**
- Top or Bottom placement.
- Auto-centering.
- Configurable fonts (Arial, Roboto, or falls back to ugly default if missing).
- Separate resizing for Title and Subtitle.

---

### H4_PixelVisualizer (Pixel Peeper)
**What it is:** A simple node that explodes an image into its raw pixel values.
**Why:** Mostly for debugging or for people who like to look at RGB hex codes instead of art.
**Usage:** Connect an image, see the color data distribution.

---

### H4_VisualTokenizer (The Mind Reader)
**What it is:** A debugging tool that shows you exactly how the AI tokenizes your prompt.
**Why use it:**
- To see why your prompt is being ignored.
- To visualize weights: `(cat:1.2)` shows up as a heavier bar.
- To see the "End of Text" token cutting off your 200-word essay.

## Model merging and saving (Mad Science)

### H4_ModelMerger (The Frankenstein Lab)
**What it is:** A granular model merger that lets you blend up to 3 models with surgical precision.
**The Feature List:**
- **Block Merging:** You can merge just the input blocks of Model A with the output blocks of Model B.
- **Granular Weights:** There are 25 knobs per model (IN00-IN11, MID, OUT00-OUT11). You can map the "Soul" (Middle Block) of PonyXL into the "Body" (Output Blocks) of Juggernaut.
- **Interpolation Modes:** Weighted Average, Symmetric Average, Add Difference, etc.
- **Live Testing:** It has a built-in generator. You can test the merge *before* saving it.
- **Safety:** It prevents you from merging SD1.5 with SDXL and creating a black hole.

**Warning:** This node is complex. If you don't know what "IN05" does, leave it at 1.0 or read a guide.

### H4_ModelSave (The Librarian)
**What it is:** Saves your merged monstrosities to disk.
**Why use it over the standard Save Node?**
- **Architecture Aware:** It knows the difference between SD1.5, SDXL, and Flux. It keys the weights correctly so you don't get "Keys missing" errors when loading it back.
- **Float16 Casting:** Automatically casts to fp16 to save space (unless you really want fp32).
- **Metadata:** Injects your prompt and workflow into the checkpoint header.

---
## Latents and Aspect Ratios

### H4_LatentSelector (The Canvas)
**What it is:** A resolution calculator and empty latent generator.
**Why:** Because calculating `1024 * (16/9)` in your head is annoying.
**Features:**
- **Presets:** 16:9 Cinema, 9:16 Story, 1:1 Square, and more.
- **Model Aware:** Adjusts baseline pixels for SD1.5 (512px) vs SDXL (1024px) vs Wan (720p).
- **Batch Size:** Crank it up if you have the VRAM.

---

## Face manipulation suite (h4_faceforge/)

### H4_FaceForge (The Plastic Surgeon)
**What it is:** A robust, all-in-one face swap engine that doesn't look like a 2005 video game.
**The Pipeline:**
1.  **Swap:** Uses InsightFace to map the source face onto the target.
2.  **Restore:** Uses CodeFormer/GFPGAN to fix the "melted wax" look.
3.  **Upscale:** Resizes the face crop for high-res detailing.
4.  **Blend:** Feathers the edges so it doesn't look like a mask sticker.
5.  **Occlusion Handling:** Tries (emphasis on *tries*) to keep hair and glasses in front of the face.

**Pro Tip:** If your face looks like a potato, turn *up* the formatting, but turn *down* the restoration strength.

### H4_IdentityEngine (The Soul Extractor)
**What it is:** It extracts the "essence" of a face (embeddings) and saves it for later.
**Why:**
- Stop re-analyzing the same 5 photos of Elon Musk every time you run a generation.
- Build a "Consistent Character" bank.
- Mix face embeddings (50% Dad, 50% Mom) using **H4_BuildFaceModel**.

### H4_FaceDetailer (The Dermatologist)
**What it is:** A texture hallucinator.
**Why:** Face swaps are smooth. Real skin has pores. This node adds the pores back.
**How:** It runs a second pass (img2img) on just the face area with a low denoise (0.2-0.3) to adding texture noise.

---

## Loaders and utilities

### H4_UniversalLoader (The Skeleton Key)
**What it is:** The only loader you need.
**What it loads:**
- **Checkpoints:** Standard `.safetensors` (SD1.5, SDXL, Flux).
- **Components:** Individual UNETs, CLIPs, and VAEs.
- **GGUF:** Yes, it auto-detects GGUF format and bridges to `ComfyUI-GGUF` internally.
- **Wan/Z-Image:** It has specific heuristics to detect Wan2.1 and Z-Image models and load them correctly (handling the weird 2560 vs 4096 dim mismatch).
**Why use it:** because wiring up 4 different loader nodes for testing is for chumps.

### H4_NodeTranslator (The Babel Fish)
**What it is:** A frontend-only node that translates the UI.
**Usage:**
- Select "Spanish", "Mandarin", or "German".
- It doesn't touch the backend. It just renames the widgets and titles in your browser so you can work in your native tongue.
- *Note:* WIP. Don't expect perfect grammar.

### H4_DisplayAny (The Universal Monitor)
**What it is:** A debug node that accepts *anything* (Images, Latents, Tensors, Text, Lists) and displays it.
**Why:**
- Wiring up a `PreviewImage` node just to check a mask is annoying.
- Wiring up a `TextOutput` node just to check a string is annoying.
- This node takes them all. It adapts. It overcomes.

### H4_DataStream (The Feed)
**What it is:** A sequential image/video loader.
**Usage:**
- Point it at a folder.
- Set index to 0.
- Enable `auto_queue_remaining`.
- Press Queue.
- **Result:** It processes every image in the folder one by one, automatically queuing the next job until the folder is empty.
**Bonus:** It also plays video files frame-by-frame if you point it at an `.mp4`.

## Debug and stealth nodes (Use at your own risk)

### H4_DebugErrorGenerator (The Crash Test Dummy)
**What it is:** It crashes ComfyUI on purpose.
**Why:** To test if your error handling / "Death Modal" is working.
**Modes:** Minor, Warning, Critical.

### H4_Discombobulator (The Glitch)
**What it is:** A UI scrambler.
**Why:** Because I was bored and wanted to see if I could make the interface look like the Matrix.
**Effect:** It intercepts notifications and turns them into leet speak or binary. Does nothing to your images. Just messes with your head.


---

### H4_SmartSave (The Hoarder's Delight)
**What it is:** A dual-mode image handler that acts as both your "Preview Image" node and your "Save Image" node, but better. It previews, it saves, it hoards metadata like a digital dragon, and it gives you a film-strip of your recent conquests.

**The "Save Mode" Switch:**
- **PREVIEW ONLY (Default/OFF):** In this mode, it acts like a standard Preview Image node. Images go to your `/temp` folder. They exist for the session, they bring you joy for a moment, and then they vanish into the void when you restart. Great for "is this prompt garbage?" checks.
- **SAVE TO DISK (ON):** Flipping this switch commits the image to your `/output` folder forever (or until you delete it). Use this when you actually make something worth keeping.

**Inputs (The Knobs):**
- **images**: The image pipe. Obviously.
- **filename_prefix**: The name template. Default is `h4_`. It supports standard ComfyUI formatting like `%date:yyyy-MM-dd%`. If you don't know how file naming works, I can't save you.
- **custom_metadata**: The fun part. A raw JSON text field where you can inject *anything* you want into the specific PNG chunks.
  - Want to tag yourself as the author? Done.
  - Want to add a "mood: grumpy" tag? Done.
  - Want to paste your grocery list? Weird flex, but done.
  - **Default Template**: comes pre-loaded with fields for Author, Model, Details, and a cheesy inspirational quote because we all need motivation.

**The Film Strip UI (The fancy part):**
- **The Strip**: A horizontal scrolling list of your last 50 generated images. It's persistant-ish.
- **Parameters Drawer**: Click a thumbnail -> Toggle the **PARAMS** switch (it won't open unless you ask nicely). A panel slides out showing *exactly* what settings created that image. It crawls the graph to find the Seed, CFG, Steps, and Prompts. No more "what seed was that?" guessing games.
- **Lightbox**: Double-click any thumbnail to see it full-screen.
  - **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or the slider at the bottom. Zooms up to 500% so you can inspect every single pixel of that waifu's eye glistening.
  - **Pan**: Drag to move around.

**Why use it:**
- Because standard SaveImage nodes are boring and don't tell you the history.
- Because you want to audit your past self's decisions without opening the PNG Info tab every 5 seconds.

---

## Display and debugging

### H4_SmartConsole (X-Ray)
**What it is:** an inline debugger.

**Modes:**
- Normal: basic info.
- ULTRA: nuclear inspection, min/max, attributes, internal structure.

Use ULTRA when you are ready to suffer, but also ready to actually fix the problem.

---

### H4_DisplayAny (Universal Monitor)

### H4_DocuScribe (The Stenographer)
**What it is:** Generates automatic markdown documentation from your workflow.
**How:** Connect nodes to its 'source' inputs. Run the workflow. It crawls the connections and writes a report to your output folder detailing every connected node, its settings, and its class type.
**Why:** The "help I need to explain this to future me" node. Perfect for generating changelogs or explaining complex graphs to others.

---

### H4_NoteInjector (Visuals)
**What it is:** adds professional title bars to images.

**Features:**
- Top/Bottom bars.
- Auto-centering for Title/Subtitle.
- Custom fonts and colors.

**When to use it:**
- Memes.
- Workflow documentation.
- "Cinematic" subtitles.

---

---

### H4_NodeTranslator (The Babel Fish)
**What it is:** Real-time translation for ComfyUI.

**What it does:**
- Translates **Node Titles** and **Widget Labels** into your language (Spanish, Mandarin, German, etc.).
- Does NOT break the backend (internal variable names stay English).
- Visual-only layer that sits on top of the UI.
- Currently marked as **(WIP)** but functional-ish.

**Why:**
- Because nodes should not be a language test. (or at least I hope not)
- Because comfyui should be accessible to everyone reagardless of language 
- Because Sometimes I dont wanna goto google translate to understand what was on the node

---

### H4_DebugErrorGenerator (Test Only)
Intentionally throws errors to test error handling.

---

### H4_Discombobulator (Use with caution)
Hidden stealth node, purpose redacted from console output.

Yes, it’s weird. Yes, it’s on purpose. No, we are not explaining it in the friendly section. Not today.
Just use it - it has no other purpose than what it does , it does not reflect, act or touch your 
wf , it just discombobulates you ^_^ 
---

### H4_LatentSelector (Resolutions)
**What it is:** Stop memorizing pixel dimensions.

**What it does:**
- You pick "SDXL" and "Portrait".
- It gives you `896 x 1152` (or whatever the optimal latent size is).
- It outputs an empty latent, width/height ints, and an empty image for referencing.

**Why:**
- Because I am tired of looking up "SD 1.5 landscape optimal resolution" on Google.

---

### H4_ModelMerger (Mad Science)
**What it is:** A checkpoint merger that treats models like data, not just weights.

**Features:**
- **Smart Tiling**: If you test a merge, it doesn't generate a crappy 512x512 preview that lies to you. It runs a proper tiled decode so you can see if the eyes are haunted.
- **Fail-Safe Decode**: If the VAE explodes (NaNs, black squares), it catches it, prints a readable error, creates a red "ERROR" image placeholder, and keeps the workflow alive so you can adjust ratios and try again.
- **Visual Ratios**: Sliders for every block.
- **Metadata Inspection**: Actually checks if you are merging SDXL with 1.5 and warns you before you create a monstrosity.

---

## Recipes (copyable patterns)
### 1) First-pass create, then refine loop
Goal: loop over refinement without rewiring.

Basic idea:
- Use **H4_TrafficRouter** to choose starter vs loop input.
- Use **H4_MissionControl** to increment loop count.
- Use **H4_ImageBuffer** to feed results back wirelessly.

Why this works:
- First loop: strong denoise, big changes.
- Later loops: lower denoise, gentle refinement.

### 2) Wireless loop without cycle errors
Goal: true feedback loop, no visible cycle.

Basic idea:
- Store output in **H4_ImageBuffer**.
- On next iteration, retrieve from Buffer instead of wiring output directly backwards.

If your loop is still “one step behind,” you likely built a laggy loop, not a buffered loop. Small difference, massive impact.

### 3) Grid testing without brain damage
Goal: sweep CFG, steps, prompts, models.

Basic idea:
- Use **H4_Gridinator** with **H4_AxisDriver**.
- Keep seeds controlled with **H4_SeedSequencer**.

This gives you structured experiments, not a folder full of mystery images.

## FAQ
### Are QoL features enabled by default?
No. They are OFF by default. You must enable them manually, one by one, in settings. There is no h4_Live “enable all QoL” switch.

### Is BigBrother spying on me?
No. It is a frontend QoL bundle. Seeing it in console does not mean it is logging anything sensitive by default.

### Why do I need ImageBuffer?
Because ComfyUI’s graph structure does not like cycles. Buffer breaks the cycle by storing data globally, so you can loop without wiring a visible loop.

### I got a scary error popup, is that normal?
Yes. Enhanced error reporting can be jarring at first, but it is designed to be dramatically more informative than standard comfy errors.

---

## Troubleshooting
### “It says cycle detected” or my loop fails
- Avoid direct output-to-input cycles in the visible graph.
- Use **H4_ImageBuffer** to store and retrieve data wirelessly.
- Verify your loop counter is actually incrementing.

### “Nothing changes across loops”
- Check loop count display using **H4_StateMonitor**.
- Ensure **H4_MissionControl** is in Active mode if it is supposed to drive loops.
- Verify seeds and denoise schedules are changing as intended.

### “Type mismatch” errors
- Use **H4_TrafficMerge** when merging streams, it includes type-safety checks.
- Add **H4_DisplayAny** or **H4_SmartConsole** temporarily to inspect what is actually flowing.

### “The UI toggles don’t show up”
- Confirm frontend extension files are installed where ComfyUI loads extensions.
- Hard refresh the browser.
- Check console for extension load logs.

## Dev Corner (technical deep dive)
This section is for the nerds, the builders, and the people who read stack traces like bedtime stories.

### Architecture philosophy
h4_Live is built around a singleton global state, typically `_H4_GLOBAL_STATE` in the core module, enabling coordinated state across nodes.

Core idea:
- Most ComfyUI graphs are stateless and acyclic.
- h4_Live injects statefulness via a controlled global store and “wireless” data transport patterns.
- This enables iterative workflows, loop counters, restart flags, and data reuse without creating illegal graph cycles.

### Wireless protocol and DAG constraints
ComfyUI expects a DAG evaluation model. Direct cycles violate structural assumptions and can break execution ordering.

h4_Live addresses this by:
- Storing intermediate artifacts in a global buffer (object references where possible).
- Rehydrating the stored object on subsequent executions.
- Preserving an acyclic graph layout while enabling feedback semantics.

### ImageBuffer implementation notes
- Accepts arbitrary payload types (images, latents, text, conditioning, and general Python objects).
- Designed to break cycles without a 1-iteration lag.
- Where possible, uses reference storage for “zero-copy-ish” behavior, minimizing deep copies and VRAM churn.

### Router and Merge control flow
**H4_TrafficRouter**
- Implements loop-aware selection logic: loop index 0 selects starter path, loop index N>0 selects loop path.
- Optionally applies denoise policy selection for creation vs refinement phases.

**H4_TrafficMerge**
- Implements loop-aware multiplexing while maintaining type discipline.
- Adds safeguards for wireless patterns to reduce cycle-related execution faults.
- Performs runtime type checks to prevent Image/Latent mismatches.

### Context bundling: H4_PIPE
**H4_ContextHub**
- Bundles canonical ComfyUI artifacts into a composite pipe type.
- Provides deterministic packing order and logging hooks for debugging.

**H4_ContextUnpack**
- Performs the inverse mapping, returning unpacked typed outputs.

### Mission control, scheduling, seeds
**H4_MissionControl**
- Active mode mutates global loop state (incrementer).
- Passive mode reads and exposes state for UI display and instrumentation.
- Responds to wireless reset flags.

**H4_LinearScheduler**
- Generates an interpolated scalar across loop domain, enabling parameter ramps.

**H4_SeedGenerator / H4_SeedSequencer**
- SeedGenerator offers fixed, incremental, random strategies based on global loop.
- SeedSequencer adds stateful internal sequencing independent of global loop count, including digit constraints and auto-advance.

### Gridinator and testing utilities
**H4_Gridinator**
- Parameter sweep orchestrator supporting fuzzy checkpoint resolution and prompt stutter expansion.
- Auto-labeling and layout generation for multi-axis grids.

**H4_AxisDriver**
- Axis iteration driver coordinating Gridinator’s sweep dimensions.

**H4_Comparinator**
- Full in-node comparison suite with custom JavaScript frontend.
- **Left Pane**: Hosts Image A and Image B in a stacked layered view with CSS `clipPath` driven by a draggable slider handle for real-time A/B wipe comparison.
- **Right Pane**: Contextual — shows either a history reference image (compare mode) or a zoom canvas (inspect mode) with `background-position`/`background-size` driven magnification.
- **Graph Traversal Engine**: `findUpstreamSamplers()` recursively walks `app.graph.links` backwards from input nodes to locate KSampler nodes. `findPromptText()` traces `positive`/`negative` conditioning inputs through `CLIPTextEncode` and `Reroute` nodes to extract prompt text from widget values.
- **Metadata Cache**: `this.metadataCache` stores extracted parameters keyed by filename, enabling accurate parameter display for historical comparisons even after graph modifications.
- **Blink Mode**: `toggleBlinkMode()` toggles Image B opacity between 0 and 1 on spacebar hold for rapid perceptual comparison.
- **Slider Mode**: `setSliderMode("A"|"B"|"Split")` manipulates `clipPath` CSS on Image B to show full A, full B, or 50/50 split.
- **History System**: Thumbnail strip with single-click select, double-click lightbox, right-click reference lock. Locked references override Image A source in `updateData()` for persistent baseline comparison.
- **Full Mode CSS**: `.full-mode` sets `pane-left` to 100% width and `pane-right` to 0%, while preserving slider and blink functionality within the expanded pane.

**H4_PixelVisualizer**
- Tensor-level pixel difference computation using `torch.abs(A - B)` with configurable amplification scale.
- Resolution mismatch handling via `F.interpolate` with bilinear mode before diff computation.
- Outputs four tensors: amplified heatmap, horizontal concatenated side-by-side, and both input passthroughs.


### Batch and inspection tooling
**H4_DataStream**
- Folder ingest and queue automation to sequentially process multiple inputs.

**H4_SmartConsole / H4_DisplayAny**
- Runtime introspection. ULTRA mode exposes deeper properties including min/max, structure, and debug metadata.

**H4_DocuScribe**
- Emits workflow documentation by analyzing graph structure and node configuration.

### FaceForge subsystem (h4_faceforge/)
**H4_FaceForge**
- Multi-stage pipeline: swap, restore, upscale, blend, occlusion-aware handling, and VRAM mitigation strategies.

**H4_IdentityEngine**
- Separates persistent persona traits (“DNA”) from scene-level prompt context.
- Preset serialization logic avoids overwriting scene text while restoring identity traits.

**H4_FaceDetailer**
- Texture restoration via controlled denoise constraints to add micro-detail while minimizing identity drift.

### H4_ModelMerger (Backend)
- **Tiled VAE Decode**: Uses a rolling buffer calculation to decode large test images without OOMing 8GB cards.
- **FP32 Fallback**: If standard FP16 decode returns NaNs (black images), it automatically casts the VAE to FP32, retries, and then casts back. This fixes the infamous "black square" issue on 16-series and some 30-series cards.
- **Garbage Collection**: Aggressive `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` calls between merge operations to prevent fragmentation.

### Frontend extensions (js/)
**BigBrother bundle**
- Provides QoL affordances: snapping, socket coloration, overlays, memory helpers, and UI behaviors.
- Explicit opt-in model, QoL toggles are disabled by default and enabled per-feature.
- Console visibility does not imply active sensitive logging, behavior is gated behind explicit settings toggles.

### Error reporting
Enhanced error reporting surfaces expanded diagnostic context beyond stock messages:
- Node identity, execution context, expected vs actual types, and state cues.
- Designed to reduce debug iteration time by providing actionable failure context.

## License and credits
This is a clean node pack. If you ship it, keep it tidy.
If you remix it, be cool about it.

We build weird tools so people can make cool stuff.
And also because we got mad at the canvas one night and chose violence.

(Yes, there might be one typo in here. As a treat. Probably.)
